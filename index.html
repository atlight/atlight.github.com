	<h2>Teaching</h2>
	<p>I'm an Associate Lecturer (Education Specialist) in the <a href="https://infrastructure.eng.unimelb.edu.au/">Department of Infrastructure Engineering</a> at the University of Melbourne, undertaking a wide range of teaching roles ranging from face-to-face classroom teaching and lecturing to behind-the-scenes curriculum development work. Recently this has included working with Martin Tomko to deliver the subject Spatial Data Management, for which we maintain a publicly-available <a href="https://tomkom.pages.gitlab.unimelb.edu.au/spatialdatamanagement/">subject book</a>.</p>
	<p>Prior to taking up this role, I was a sessional tutor in the <a href="http://cis.unimelb.edu.au">School of Computing and Information Systems</a> at the University of Melbourne, where I delivered weekly workshops to a diverse range of engineering, IT, maths and science students taking the subjects <a href="https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/comp20005">Engineering Computation</a> and <a href="https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/info20003">Database Systems</a>.
	<!--p>Some of the teaching materials I've created over the years are on <a href="https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/athomas3">my <abbr title="Melbourne School of Engineering">MSE</abbr> personal homepage</a>. Note that, under the University's copyright policies, copyright in these materials is vested in the University. Much of the content has been written by me, but many of the graphics and questions (particularly for Database Systems) were taken from other places.</p-->
	
	<h2>Wikimedia</h2>
	<p>The Wikimedia Foundation hosts a range of collaboratively-edited, freely-licensed wiki projects, such as Wikipedia and Wiktionary. Many Foundation staff also contribute to the open-source wiki software <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org">MediaWiki</a>. Using the username <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:This,_that_and_the_other">This, that and the other</a>, or TTO for short, I've become part of the vibrant volunteer community that has sprung up around these projects.</p>
	<p>From 2011 to 2020, I developed and maintained <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:This,_that_and_the_other/For_the_Common_Good">For the Common Good</a>, a desktop application which allows Wikimedia users to transfer images and media files from their local wiki to Wikimedia Commons, the central repository. FtCG is no longer maintained, but you can still <a href="ftcg/">download the final release and access all FtCG resources</a> on this site.</p>
	<p>Other highlights include a spell as one of the core maintainers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Twinkle">Twinkle</a> on English Wikipedia, and more recently, development of English Wiktionary's <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Todo/Lists">Todo Lists</a> infrastructure.</p>
	
	<h2>Geospatial</h2>
	<p>For some time I've been undertaking geospatial software development work for <a href="https://thinkspatial.com.au/">ThinkSpatial</a>, including:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Specialised backend and frontend development on <a href="https://www.civillo.com">Civillo</a>, a web app that allows users to display and interact with 2D and 3D CAD and GIS data on a map</li>
		<li>Developing a small <a href="https://uom-pos.thinkspatial.com.au">positioning web app</a> that demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of mobile geolocation and acts as a geodesy teaching tool</li>
		<li>Improving the <a href="https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/dxf.html">AutoCAD DXF driver</a> in <a href="https://gdal.org">GDAL</a>, the open-source geospatial data conversion tool; I am now the <a href="https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/blob/master/COMMITTERS">primary maintainer</a> of this driver</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Anyone who is working with DXF data might find these notes useful:</p>
