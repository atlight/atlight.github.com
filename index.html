	<h2>Teaching</h2>
	<p>I'm a Senior Tutor in the <a href="https://infrastructure.eng.unimelb.edu.au/">Department of Infrastructure Engineering</a> at the University of Melbourne, undertaking a wide range of teaching roles, involving face-to-face classroom teaching and lecturing as well as behind-the-scenes curriculum development work.</p>
	<p>Prior to taking up this role, I was a sessional tutor in the <a href="http://cis.unimelb.edu.au">School of Computing and Information Systems</a> at the University of Melbourne, where I delivered weekly workshops to a diverse range of engineering, IT, maths and science students taking the subjects <a href="https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/comp20005">Engineering Computation</a> and <a href="https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/info20003">Database Systems</a>.
	<!--p>Some of the teaching materials I've created over the years are on <a href="https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/athomas3">my <abbr title="Melbourne School of Engineering">MSE</abbr> personal homepage</a>. Note that, under the University's copyright policies, copyright in these materials is vested in the University. Much of the content has been written by me, but many of the graphics and questions (particularly for Database Systems) were taken from other places.</p-->

	<h2>Geospatial</h2>
	<p>For some time I've been undertaking geospatial software development work for <a href="http://thinkspatial.com.au/" title="yes, in spite of their slightly broken and outdated website, they are still very much in business">ThinkSpatial</a>, including:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Developing a small <a href="https://uom-pos.thinkspatial.com.au">positioning web app</a> that demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of mobile geolocation and acts as a geodesy teaching tool</li>
		<li>Improving the <a href="http://gdal.org/drv_dxf.html">AutoCAD DXF driver</a> in <a href="http://gdal.org">GDAL</a>, the geospatial data conversion tool</li>
	</ul>
