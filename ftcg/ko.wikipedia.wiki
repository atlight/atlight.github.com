# If you don't have three, just remove the unneeded ones

# IMPORTANT: All entries from here onwards are treated as regular expressions.
# For normal text entry, this should not be a problem, but when using

# If you aren't technically confident, stop here and delete everything from here to the end
# (FtCG will still work!)



# Potential problems - conditions which may prevent or affect transfer (like deletion templates)

# Notes: - Use IfContains= to search for a string of plain text (case-insensitive)
#        - Use IfRegex= to match against a regex (case-insensitive)
# These should be listed in order of importance - most "problematic" first.

# LookFor is a regular expression; ReplaceWith is a "replacement pattern"
# where $n is the nth "capture" of the regex; for help,
